MCProxy is a python application that aims to:
	Proxy minecraft packet connections between clients and servers
	Packet inspection on that link
	Implement features/restrictions on the minecraft game by modifying the packet stream

The main proxy (in the top level directory) is the guts and provides a framework for making plugins.
Plugins are in the plugins directory and are loaded in order. This order is set in the plugins.py file.

All packets recieved are filtered through each plugin in order. Each plugin may replace it, modify it or just drop it completely.
See the plugin spec for details.

Within the plugins directory there are several core plugins that provide a framework for player interaction and other useful tasks.
