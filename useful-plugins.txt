The following plugins are designed for use by other plugins.
You may depend on their presence - please use them.

usernames
	Doesn't need to be imported directly.
	This module ensures that the user's name is available under user.username

timed_events
	Still in testing/development. Used for scheduling functions to occur at a later time.

player_cmd
	Register functions to be called when players type a given message. Runs on regex :D.

menus
	Menu interface system for any situation where you want players to read pages of text,
	interactively pick an option, etc.
	Highly flexible but somewhat overly so - see menu_test for good example usage.

plugin_helpers
	Still in development. This is the place for any helper functions that don't need a seperate plugin
	but require other plugins to operate (and so cannot go in helpers.py to prevent cyclic dependencies).
